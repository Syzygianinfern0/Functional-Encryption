# Reading In The Dark: Classifying Encrypted Digits with Functional Encryption
ðŸ§© Efficient Computation of Quadratic Multi-Variate Polynomials on Encrypted Vectors


**A fork of an awesome implementation of [this](https://github.com/edufoursans/reading-in-the-dark) by [@edufoursans](https://github.com/edufoursans).**

The reason for the existence of this repo is to serve as a playground for the cleaner and WiP implementation in over at
[OpenMined](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyFE)
